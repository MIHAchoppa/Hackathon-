- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Build validation and testing
- `.github/workflows/README.md` - Workflow documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical implementation details

### Files Updated

- `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` - Added automated GitHub Pages option

## 🚀 How to Deploy (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (One-time Setup)
1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/MIHAchoppa/Hackathon-
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages** (in the left sidebar)
3. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
4. Click **Save**

That's it for setup! You only need to do this once.

### Step 2: Deploy Your Site
```bash
# Make sure all changes are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Ready to deploy"

# Push to main branch
git push origin main
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- ✅ Validate the build
- ✅ Run tests
- ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Make your site live

### Step 3: Check Deployment Status
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Watch the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow run
3. Deployment completes in 30-60 seconds
4. Your site is live at: **https://mihachoppa.github.io/Hackathon-/**

## 📊 Monitoring

### Status Badges (in README.md)
- ![Deploy Status](https://github.com/MIHAchoppa/Hackathon-/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)
- ![Build Status](https://github.com/MIHAchoppa/Hackathon-/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

These badges show the current deployment and build status.

### Check Workflow Logs
- Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
- Click on any workflow run
- View detailed logs for each step

## 🎯 What Happens Automatically

### On Every Push to Main
1. **CI Workflow Runs**:
   - Validates project structure
   - Runs build script
   - Tests Python dependencies
   - Uploads build artifacts

2. **Deploy Workflow Runs**:
   - Checks out code
   - Configures GitHub Pages
   - Uploads site content
   - Deploys to production

### On Pull Requests
- CI workflow validates the changes
- Ensures build succeeds before merging
- Prevents broken deployments
