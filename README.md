## üéØ About

This repository contains the codebase for an innovative hackathon project. Our goal is to build a cutting-edge solution that addresses real-world challenges through collaborative development and creative problem-solving.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI ResearchBot**: Intelligent research assistant with confidence scoring on any topic
- **Voice Input Integration**: Use Groq's Whisper model for voice-to-text research topics
- **Custom Distance/Range Input**: Add kilometer-based context to your research with distance analysis
- **Probability-Based Insights**: Each research point includes confidence scores (0-100%)
- **Structured Research**: Organized insights covering overview, statistics, distance analysis, pros/cons, and recommendations
- **Export Functionality**: Download research results as JSON or CSV
- **Book Generation**: Create formatted books from your research with multiple styles and structures
- **Innovative Solution**: Addresses specific problem domain with modern technology
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with best practices and scalability in mind
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development with transparent processes
- **Well-Documented**: Comprehensive documentation for developers and users
- **Extensible**: Modular design allowing easy customization and extensions

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Git for version control
- A modern code editor (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)
- Node.js (v14 or higher) - if applicable
- npm or yarn package manager - if applicable

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MIHAchoppa/Hackathon-.git
   cd Hackathon-
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables (if applicable):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

## üìñ Usage

### AI ResearchBot

The ResearchBot feature allows you to generate comprehensive research insights with AI confidence scoring:

1. **Navigate to the Research section** on the homepage
2. **Enter a topic** in the input field (e.g., "Electric Cars", "AI Technology", "Renewable Energy")
   - **OR use voice input** by clicking the üé§ microphone button to speak your topic
3. **Optionally add distance/range context** in the km input field (e.g., 500 for 500 kilometers)
   - This adds a "Distance Analysis" section to your results with km-specific insights
4. **Click the "Research" button** to generate insights
5. **View results** organized by sections with confidence scores:
   - üü¢ Green badges: High confidence (90%+)
   - üü° Yellow badges: Medium confidence (70-89%)
   - üî¥ Red badges: Low confidence (<70%)
6. **Export your research** using the JSON or CSV export buttons

### Voice Input with Groq Whisper

To enable voice-to-text transcription:

1. **Get a free Groq API key** at [https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)
2. **Set your API key** in the browser console:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('groq_api_key', 'your_groq_api_key_here')
   ```
3. **Click the microphone button** and speak your research topic
4. **The text will appear** in the research input field automatically

**Note**: If a Groq API key is not configured, the system will fall back to the browser's built-in speech recognition (if available).

### Development

For local development:

```bash
# Start a local server
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx http-server

# Open in browser
# Navigate to http://localhost:8000
```
