## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Git for version control
- A modern code editor (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)
- Node.js (v14 or higher) - if applicable
- npm or yarn package manager - if applicable

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MIHAchoppa/Hackathon-.git
   cd Hackathon-
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables (if applicable):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

## 📖 Usage

### AI ResearchBot

The ResearchBot feature allows you to generate comprehensive research insights with AI confidence scoring:

1. **Navigate to the Research section** on the homepage
2. **Enter a topic** in the input field (e.g., "Electric Cars", "AI Technology", "Renewable Energy")
3. **Click the "Research" button** to generate insights
4. **View results** organized by sections with confidence scores:
   - 🟢 Green badges: High confidence (90%+)
   - 🟡 Yellow badges: Medium confidence (70-89%)
   - 🔴 Red badges: Low confidence (<70%)
5. **Export your research** using the JSON or CSV export buttons

### Development

For local development:

```bash
# Start a local server
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx http-server

# Open in browser
# Navigate to http://localhost:8000
```
