## 🚀 Key Achievements

### Core Innovation: ORABL Loop

Our agent operates through a continuous **Observe → Reason → Act → Learn** cycle:

```
OBSERVE 👁️
  ↓ Gather information, check memory
REASON 🧠
  ↓ Analyze, calculate confidence (5-factor algorithm)
ACT ⚡
  ↓ Execute based on confidence level
LEARN 📚
  ↓ Extract insights, update patterns
  ↺ Loop continues
```

   - Reasons: Analyzes data, calculates confidence
   - Acts: Generates comprehensive research via AI models
   - Learns: Stores patterns for future tasks
3. Outputs professional research with confidence scores
4. Export as JSON or CSV

### Book Generation
1. Select research sections to include
2. Configure style and structure
3. Agent enhances content with AI insights
4. Generates complete book with confidence tracking
5. Export as HTML, PDF, or Markdown

### Real-time Monitoring
- Live agent dashboard shows current phase
- Iteration count and confidence scores
- Reasoning chain with step-by-step breakdown
